       "  <li> The first commercial steam-powered device was a <b>water pump</b>, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.</li>\n",
       "<li> Using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical.</li>\n",
       "<li> Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.</li>\n",
       "<li> Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines.</li>\n",
       "<li> The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century.</li>\n",
       "<li> Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.</li>\n",
       "<li> It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher.</li>\n",
       "<li> For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors.</li>\n",
       "<li> The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications.</li>\n",
       "<li> Reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage, and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation.</li>\n",
       "<li> The first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712.</li>\n",
       "<li> It received some use in mines, pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery.</li>\n",
       "<li> Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines.</li>\n",
       "<li> A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured.</li>\n",
       "<li> Land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam, as feed water was usually readily available.</li>\n",
       "<li> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.</li>\n",
       "<li> Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories, mills and mines; powering pumping stations; and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives, ships, steamboats and road vehicles.</li>\n",
       "<li> The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser.</li>\n",
       "<li> Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines, the \"steam age\" is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century.</li>\n",
       "<li> Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.</li>\n",
       "<li> The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system.</li>\n",
       "<li> There have at one time or another been steam-powered farm tractors, motorcycles (without much success) and even automobiles as the Stanley Steamer.</li>\n",
       "<li> Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water.</li>\n",
       "<li> The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\".</li>\n",
       "<li> The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced, but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives.</li>\n",
